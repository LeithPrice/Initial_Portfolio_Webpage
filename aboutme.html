      <h2>Work / Study History</h2>
      <div class="image" ><img src="/images/Leith_Price.jpg"></div>
      <p>Since completing year 12 in 1999, I have been self employed for the better part of 20 years. Specializing in local and interstate transport services. Being the head of a large employer, i have had extensive experience in managing different personalities and encouraging them to give their best. As i began to wind up my interests in Transport i did RPL and got my qualifications in Heavy Vehicle Mechanics, Auto Electrics and Automotive airconditioning. For the past three years i have enjoyed a healthy balance of work time and family time for the first time in my career.</p>
      <p>  I am currently undertaking Training to complete my Diploma in IT with the intention of entering a rewarding career that will compliment my experiences at this stage in my life.  </p>

      <h2>Skills / Interests</h2>
      <div class="image" ><img src="/images/Children.jpg"></div>
      <p> Early in my career in transport my most flaunted skill was the ability to work 20+ hours a day consistantly for months on end without cracking or dropping the ball. Nowdays i find my best skill is the ability to look at something with a fresh perspective and suggest new ways of addressing the problem.</p>
      <p> My interest lay predominantly with being there for my children as they grow and learn. We go camping and four wheel driving. We swim in creeks and lakes and rivers. We try new hobbies like dancing or karate or swimming. Outside of work i make myself 100% available to them and that is my Interest.</p>
